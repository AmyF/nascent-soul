description="The core of this plugin is the `Zone` system, a powerful area manager that lets you build diverse game mechanics by combining different logic modules:

- **Permission Control** (`ZonePermission`): Governs which objects are allowed to enter a specific zone.
- **Layout Management** (`ZoneLayout`): Manages how objects are arranged, featuring built-in Arc, Pile, and Horizontal layouts.
- **Display Logic** (`ZoneDisplay`): Controls the visual appearance of objects, including hover effects, selection states, and more.
- **Interaction Handling** (`ZoneInteraction`): Processes user input like clicks, drags, and multi-selection.
- **Sorting Logic** (`ZoneSort`): Defines the automatic sorting order for objects within a zone.

Additionally, the plugin provides a ready-to-use `ZoneCard` implementation, complete with support for flip animations and highlight effects."
